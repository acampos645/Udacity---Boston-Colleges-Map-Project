# Neighborhood Map Project
This is single-page web application that shows the information of 10 prominent schools in the Boston area.  It was done so using Knockout.js, the Google Maps API and Wikipedia API

##Accessing App:
The application can be accessed at the following link: [acampos645.github.com](http://acampo645.github.io/)

Once the page has loaded, a map of Boston will be shown with markers representing each of the ten schools.  An interactive list is included on the left side of the screen.

##Using the App
Information for each marker can be accessed in one of two ways:

* Clicking on each of the markers will open up an infowindow  with more informatoin for each school.  This includes information requested from and a link to its associated Wikipedia article.  When each marker is clicked, the icon turns green so that the user knows which markers have been red.  Marker color can be reset using the button provided in the left side bar.

* School address and websites are shown in the left list.  It also includes a search function that filters the markers and school listings in real time.  Clicking on a listing will open an infowindow and recenter the map on the corresponding marker
