# Neighborhood Map Project
This is single-page web application that shows the information of 10 prominent schools in the Boston area.  It was done so using Knockout.js, the Google Maps API and Wikipedia API

Since I have worked in Boston and been involved in college admissions, I felt that creating a basic map showing the layout of schools in the city would be good practice

##Accessing App:
The application can be accessed at the following link: 

*[acampos645.github.com](http://acampos645.github.io/)

Once the page has loaded, a map of Boston will be shown with markers representing each of the ten schools.  An interactive list is included on the left side of the screen.

Alternatively, the app can be run locally by downloading the files from the following Github repository:

*[https://github.com/acampos645/acampos645](https://github.com/acampos645/acampos645)

Once downloaded, the app can be opened by using a browser to open the index.html file

##Using the App
Information for each marker can be accessed in one of two ways:

* Clicking on each of the markers will open up an infowindow  with more informatoin for each school.  This includes information requested from and a link to its associated Wikipedia article.  When each marker is clicked, the icon turns green so that the user knows which markers have been red.

* School address and websites are shown in the left list.  It also includes a search function that filters the markers and school listings in real time.  Clicking on a listing will open an infowindow and recenter the map on the corresponding marker

##Future Direction
In future iterations of this project, I would like to add the following features:

*Filtering of schools based on student GPA and SAT scores
*Implementation of Yelp API to show points of interest near each college
